Description: You must damage people to stay alive. Kill people to get rewards. This should help increase the pace and eliminate some camping.
Requirements: No classes or weapon packs
Recommendations: LMS/TLMS is a bad idea. Possession won't work. You probably also want to set sv_losefrag to 1. You also need a decent amount of people.
Customization: The entire mode is customizable with the following CVars:
bloodthirst_gainamount - How much of the meter you gain per hit. (Default: 5)
bloodthirst_startamount - How much of the meter you start with (out of 100). Note that the value is offset from 5. So setting it to 20 is actually 25.(Default: 40)
bloodthirst_takeamount - How much of the meter to take away each time. (Default: 1)
bloodthirst_takerate - How fast the meter drains per second (35 / bloodthirst_takerate). (Default: 4)
bloodthirst_automanage - Auto manages the above svars. There is only support for when there are less than 6 players and more than 6 players.
