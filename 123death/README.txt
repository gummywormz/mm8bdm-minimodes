Description: It's 123 Death from LMSGames, but it can be played on any map. You get a random weapon every few seconds and only have a limited amount of time before it is taken away.
Requirements: LMS or TLMS
Recommendations: Set sv_lmscountdowntime to 6 or so (it's not done automatically this time). The anticamp command is still here. Also, you can set the amount of seconds each person has to kill with OneTwoThreeDeath_weapontime (default is 12)
